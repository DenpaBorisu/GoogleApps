GoogleNews Android app

This app started out as a way to view Google News on an Android phone or tablet, 
but now encompasses Google+, Google Reader, GMail, and other Google services. The 
idea is to be able to access the Google web apps without having to log into Google 
on your browser, so that you can browse privately. Links to external sites (such as 
news articles, etc.) will be opened in your default browser, thus keeping the Google 
authentication sandboxed in the app. Also, the Google web apps are very powerful and 
less bandwidth-intensive than the respective apps.
